# Eden-New-Dawn-Classic-Textures 
This is a simple self made project to gather/recreate the old textures from Eden World Builder IOS game in order to make a pack that can be used in the new version Eden: New Dawn.
There currently seems to be a problem with the custom texture pack feature in the game so this is not working for now.
