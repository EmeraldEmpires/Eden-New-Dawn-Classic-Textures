# Eden-New-Dawn-Classic-Textures 
This is a simple self made project to gather/recreate the old textures from Eden World Builder IOS game in order to make a pack that can be used in the new version Eden: New Dawn.
This pack is in the  testing phase. All Textures have been completed. The greyscale has to be redone as the stone texture will not return to the default colour when the second grey colour from the top of the colour picker in the game is used.
